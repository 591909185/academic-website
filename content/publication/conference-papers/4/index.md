abstract: Nonlinear energy harvesters have been widely studied inthe last decade. Their broad bandwidth and relatively highpower output contribute to energy harvesting applications.However, the coexisting multiple orbits brought by thenonlinearity weaken the performance of nonlinear energyharvesters. This paper proposes to achieve orbit jumps ofmonostable energy harvesters by a bidirectional energyconversion circuit. Changing the switch control sequence in thebidirectional energy conversion circuit facilitates it with boththe energy harvesting and vibration exciting functions. Thus, anonlinear energy harvester in connection with the circuit canharness ambient energy as well as excite itself, through energyharvesting and vibration exciting modes separately. Based onthe concept of vibration exciting, the energy saved in thestorage is used to stimulate the piezoelectric transducer for alarger vibration amplitude, which enables orbit jumps. Theworking mechanism of the circuit is introduced. Experimentalsetup of a monostable energy harvester has been developed tovalidate the proposed method. The monostable system can bestimulated to high-energy orbit from a small vibrationamplitude by the vibration exciting mode of the circuit. It is alsorevealed that the method can achieve orbit jumps in a widefrequency range within the hysteresis area. Evaluations onenergy consumption and energy gain show that the sacrificedenergy can be quickly recovered. A novel approach for orbitjumps of monostable energy harvesters is performed so as toopen new opportunities for monostable energy harvesters.
